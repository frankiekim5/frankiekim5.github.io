## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally and it is expected to grow to more than 23.6 million fatalities a year by 2030. Early detection and accurate diagnosis of cardiovascular disease can be the difference between life or death.

Machine Learning algorithms for predicting cardiovascular disease can improve prevention and provide critical insight for physicians to determine the correct treatment and diagnosis. We aim to find factors that are useful in predicting cardiovascular disease and compare the performance of different supervised classification algorithms.

## Methods
Heart Disease UCI has made their data available with information from 303 individuals. The dataset provides basic features such as age and sex as well as features that are crucial to diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, cholestorol levels, and blood sugar levels.

The goal is to predict the binary class ‘target’, which indicates whether or not a patient has cardiovascular disease.
	0 = cardiovascular disease present
	1 = no cardiovascular disease present

Main contribution from this project is to understand different supervised learning model’s performance and its architecture - Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree.
