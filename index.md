## Introduction
Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death globally, and it is expected to cause more than 23.6 million fatalities a year by 2030. One's survival from cardiovascular disease solely depends on early detection and accurate diagnosis of the disease.

We can utilize Machine Learning algorithms to predict how likely one is to be diagnosed with cardiovascular disease, which can be used to improve prevention rate and to provide a critical insight for physicians to provide correct treatment for the patient. In this project, we compare and contrast several ML algorithms for prediction of cardiovascular disease to choose the most accurate one of all, and analyze them to identify the factors to which the algorithm is the best fit for our given dataset.

## Methods
Heart Disease UCI has made their data available with information from 303 individuals. The dataset provides basic features such as age and sex as well as features that are crucial to diagnosing cardiovascular disease such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and blood sugar levels.

The goal is to predict the binary class ‘target’, which indicates whether or not a patient has cardiovascular disease. A value of 0 indicates a patient with cardiovascular disease while a value of 1 indicates a patient without cardiovascular disease.

We will be utilizing three different supervised learning methods to compare the performances and accuracies. Those three methods are Neural Network, Support Vector Machine, and Decision Tree.

## Expected Results
Based off of known factors that are significant to detecting cardiovascular disease, we predict out algorithm to find similar traits that correlate with those factors. From our dataset, we estimate that the values for resting blood pressure would be high as well as the value for serum cholesterol. Another factor that would be included would be the level of fasting blood sugar. Therefore, we believe that a patient who has high blood sugar, blood pressure, and cholesterol will be at high risk for cardiovascular disease.
